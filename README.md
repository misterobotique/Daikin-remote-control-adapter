# Schematic and BOM of "remote control adapter" for Daikin's wired remote controls

# Backstory
In order to reverse engineer the communication protocol of the Daikin air conditioner installed in my bedroom, I purchased a second hand wired remote control.
Unfortunately, the original attachments were missing and the cable that came with the air conditioner didn't fit the connector on the wired remote control.
I downloaded the installation manual and discovered the wired remote control doesn't connect directly to the air conditioner:
[wired remote control] -- "remote controller cord" --> ["remote control adapter"] -- cable delivered with air conditioner --> [air conditioner]
While the "remote controller cord" is sold separately, there was no part number or information for buying this "remote control adapter".
After inquiring Daikin customer service, they confirmed me it is not sold separately and the only way to obtain one is to buy a brand new wired remote control.
I easily found sites where to buy the "remote controller cord" but spent almost two months looking at selling ads for wired remote control, until I found someone willing to sell me only the "remote control adapter".
